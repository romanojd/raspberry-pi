# Build and Program Your Own Computer with a Raspberry Pi

## Class Description
Students born after 2000 are familiar with mobile phones, iPads, GPS, digital photos, streaming music and video, yet fewer and fewer kids are acquiring the understanding and skills to invent the next generation of technology.  This class aims to tackle that.  Developed with STEM in mind (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), the Raspberry Pi is a credit card-sized computer specifically designed for learning about computing and electronics concepts.  Students will learn about computers (from the inside out), while designing animations, building and playing an original game, and wiring their own circuits. All supplies are included in the class fee, including a Raspberry Pi computer, which students can take home at the conclusion of class!

## Class Objectives
The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card-sized computer developed specifically for teaching basic computing and electronics concepts.
Each student will:
- learn how to setup and use a Raspberry Pi
- learn how to control a computer using programming languages and tools
- design and create their own computer project
- learn many fundamental computing and electronics concepts

## Units
Topics of instruction will draw from the following units according to the age and skill level of the students:
- **Building a Raspberry Pi computer**:  The basics include learning about the components of the Raspberry Pi, how to setup a working computer, and what you can accomplish with a Raspberry Pi.
- **Programming from Scratch**:  Basic computer programming concepts will be introduced using Scratch, a graphical programming language developed by MIT.
- **Designing Computer Graphics**:  Turtle graphics is a programming technique that enables students to develop complex designs with computer instructions.
- **Advanced Programming with Python**:  More advanced, text-based computer programming will be taught using Python, a widely-used high-level programming language.
- **Introduction to Electronics**:  The Raspberry Pi includes an interface for students to connect to custom electronic circuits using LEDs, switches, resistors, etc. 

## Class Supplies
Each student will work on their own Raspberry Pi.  The cost of that equipment will be included in the class fee.  At the end of the class, each student will be able to take home their own Raspberry Pi.  This includes the following itemized equipment list.
- Raspberry Pi, Model B+
- SD Card
- Power Supply
- Monitor Cable (HDMI to DVI)

## Class Logistics
The class is structured around six 1-hour lessons.  Each lesson is focused on a separate topic of instruction.  The class is located at my home office near Lake Anne in Reston.  I will coordinate the class meeting time to the participants, but typically the class will meet in the afternoons, one class per week.  The cost of this class is $125, including a Raspberry Pi.

Alternatively, I am teaching this same class through the Reston Community Center at Hunter's Woods.  The next session will begin on February 17 at 5:00 pm.  Look for the class in the Winter Program Guide.  They charge $100 for Reston-residents.  A summer camp will also be offered.

A more in-depth version of the class is also available.  The class covers the same six lessons, but meets for 2 hours instead of one.  The extra hour allows us to cover some more advanced topics and gives the students more time to explore and work on their creations.  The cost of this class is $200.
