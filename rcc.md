# Raspberry Pi at the Reston Community Center

## Raspberry Pi
### (10 - 12 years old)

Students born after 2000 are familiar with mobile phones, iPads, GPS, digital photos, streaming music and video.  This program will add to those skills to lay the foundation for the technical skills and understanding needed to invent the next generation of technology.  Developed with STEM in mind, the Raspberry Pi is a credit card-sized computer specifically designed for learning about computing and electronics concepts.  Participants will learn about computers (from the inside out), while designing animations, building and playing an original game, and wiring their own circuits.  All supplies are included in the class fee, including a Raspberry Pi computer, which students can take home at the conclusion of class.
